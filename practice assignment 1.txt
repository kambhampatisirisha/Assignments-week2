1.what you have learn on code concept
I learned about basic programming,definitions,syntax.

2.what you have learn standard code?
If defines set of technical definitions and guidelines.It gives all the necessary requirements for the product,services and opertions.

3.Explain about static variables and Instance variables?
Static variable is common for all the instances of the class since it is a class level variable.
Instance method is nothing but which access static variables directly and also called as objects.

4.Difference between sonarqube and sonarlint?
Sonarlint gives feedback for the code you entered.It is available in IDE(Intellij,Eclipse and Visualv Studio).
sonarqude is a central server. It analyses all the source lines of your project on a regular basis.

5.use continue and return in if else conditions and switch case considering two variables?
Public class Ifswitch
{
int i=30;
int j=4;
public void Ifcondition()
{
if(i<j){
   system.out.println(j+ " is greater than " +i);}
   else {
   system.out.println(i+ " is greater than " +j);
   }
}
public void switchdemo() {
  switch(i)
{
case 1:if(i<10) {
system.out.println("i is less than 10");}
break;
case 2:if(i>10) {
system.out.println("i is greater than 10");}
break;
default:
system.out.println("i is something");
    }
}
public void loopdemo() {
  while(j<=i) {
   system.out.println(j);
j=j+2;
while(j>25) {
    continue;
    }
   }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  Ifswitch obj=new Ifswitch();
obj.switchdemo();
obj.Ifcondition();
obj.loopdemo();
  }
}
